Maggie - Our first attempt at a BI component
============================================

In this repo I'll upload and test the components of our soon-to-be business intelligence, data hygiene and testing suite. To begin with, I'll use it to learn to develop with the company's already accepted tools (Capistrano, Rake, etcetera) and some new ones (like Vagrant). As it gets developed, it should be the seed of our BI component, able to speak to the rest of the platform components.
